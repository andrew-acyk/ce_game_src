Changes to InitialGameBuild:

- Add comment lines to parameter table.  They start with #.
- All the parameter-value pairs start with parameter name 
  (before colon).  The name are capitalized.  This is 
  for separating header from value.
- I replace the choices for game_type, market, and login with 
  actual values in the table.

Problem with InitialGameBuild.py
- Should not parse parameter-value pairs by linecount, 
  use the parameter name instead.  This would allow parameter-value
  pairs to move around without breaking the code.
- #!/usr/bin/python3 must be on the first line.
  Put the #Date, #Author, #Description after the first line.
- Put all the string values in static variables and declare them
  at the beginning of the program.
- Should separate the parsing and reading of the parameter file 
  from the insertion of new records into the table. It will insert
  the new records only if the parameter file is totally correct.
  This would avoid removal of dangling records if the parameter file
  was found to be incorrect at the end.
- Add complete and adequate logging to the program.  Write sql 
  statement to the log if exception occurs.
- Program InitialGameBuild.py is not working.
